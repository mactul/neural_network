# neural_network

Neural network is a little program, who makes a native neural network, sklearn compatible.

You train your network with sklearn and after, we can use it in an old or mini version of python (only math module is required and you can remove it if you are using relu as activation function)

My Casio graph 35+E calculator can run this program !


Use the program trainer.py to train your neural network and use network.py to run the network


Enjoy !
